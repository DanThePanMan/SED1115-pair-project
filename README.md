# SED1115 Pair Project

Daniel Chen and Cailan Ferguson

### Version 3
This was prepared very quickly after we did testing on version 2
and observed way too many bugs in the previous version.
We decided to burn it all down and quickly hacked up the minimum 
viable product for this project in person.

While I'm the only one pushing it to git, it combines both of our contributions
on the other branches.
